# Welcome to the Weather App Expo Project ðŸ‘‹

This project is an Expo application designed to provide weather information based on user location. Follow the steps below to set up and run the project.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- Node.js (version 14 or later)
- npm (comes with Node.js)
- Expo CLI (install globally with `npm install -g expo-cli`)

### Step 1: Install Dependencies

Navigate to the project directory in your terminal and run the following command to install the necessary dependencies:

```
npm install
```

### Step 2: Start the App

Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the app with:

```
npx expo start
```

This command will launch the Expo development server. You will see options to open the app in:

- A development build
- An Android emulator
- An iOS simulator
- Expo Go (a mobile app for testing)

### Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- **app/**: Contains the main application code.
  - **_layout.tsx**: The root layout component for the app.
  - **index.tsx**: The main entry point for the weather functionality.
  - **components/**: Contains reusable components like `WeatherInfo`, `WeatherMap`, and `CoordinatesModal`.
  - **types/**: Defines TypeScript interfaces for weather data and location data.
  - **hooks/**: Custom hooks for managing weather data.
  - **services/**: Contains the weather service for fetching weather data from an API.
  - **utils/**: Utility functions for handling location data.

### Step 3: Developing the App

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. The project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction), making it easy to manage navigation and components.
